This will convert all the .mp4 files in the current folder to .mp3 128kbps using avconv

I needed quickly to convert some mp4 music videos to mp3. Program ffmpeg was used in previous programs but after ubuntu does not allow to install it anymore , I had to use avconv instead. It seems both the programs are same.
